About me
======
I am a PhD student in the [School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at Washington State University](https://school.eecs.wsu.edu/).

My general research interests are in Low-power VLSI design and Computer Architecture with a focus on Proccessing-In-Memory (PIM) Architectures for Machine Learning (ML) and Graph Applications. The overarching goal of my research is to develop high performance and energy-efficient architectures for domain-specific hardware accelerators in existing and emerging technologies to address the latency, security/privacy, and communication bandwidth concerns associated with edge/on-device computing. 

My current research principally revolves around these specific topics:

In-memory computing
Emerging memory technologies, circuit and architectures
Neuromorphic computing systems
Accelerating Deep Learning
Machine Learning Inspired Three-dimensional (3D) NoC Architectures


Before grad school, I got my Bachelors of Science (B.Sc.) degree in Electronic and Electrical Engineering from Obafemi Awolowo University, Nigeria.

I am very fortunate to work with my advisor [Prof. Partha Pande](https://eecs.wsu.edu/~pande/), and co-advisor [Prof. Jana Doppa](https://eecs.wsu.edu/~jana/).
