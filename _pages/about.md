About me
======
I am a PhD candidate in the [School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at Washington State University](https://school.eecs.wsu.edu/).

My general research areas of interest are Low-power VLSI design, Proccessing-In-Memory (PIM) Architectures, Deep Neural Networks and Machine Learning Hardware Accelerators. The goal of my research is to develop high performance and energy-efficient domain-specific architectures for accelerating Machine Learning training and inferencing on the edge (on-device). Overall, my work seeks to address the energy, latency, security/privacy, concerns associated with today's existing architectures. 

My current research principally revolves around these specific topics:

1. Proccessing-In-Memory (PIM) Architectures for Machine Learning and Graph Applications.
2. Emerging memory technologies, circuit and architectures.
3. Neuromorphic computing systems.
4. 3D-Heterogeneous Computing. 

I am very fortunate to work with my advisor [Prof. Partha Pande](https://eecs.wsu.edu/~pande/), and co-advisor [Prof. Jana Doppa](https://eecs.wsu.edu/~jana/).
